# Copoly-Calc
Web application for copolymer synthesis:

This project stems from a previous, unfinished program developed by me (Kiefer Jackson) in C++.  The goal of this project was to adapt the foundational code of the C++ program to a web application which would allow for a greater user experience through a graphical-user-interface (GUI).  As the C++ program was unfinished and only interactable through a command-line prompt, the primary goals of this project were to:
 
    (1) - Develop a user-friendly GUI for entering data using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
 
    (2) - Complete the programming for 'data processing' and copolymer calculations and adapt them to JavaScript
 
    (3) - Implement a real-time 'data-processing' that dynamically determines the validity of a user's inputs
    
Once all of these goals have been completed, potential additions could be the ability to save reaction conditions (e.g. number of monomers, name of functional groups, etc) for future use, in addition to supplemental analytical tools for copolymer and homopolymer synthesis.

*Acknowledgments:*

I would like to thank James Brown for consulting me through the chemistry aspect of the program. Specifically, understanding what the application should feature to aid chemists, in addition to his help making sense of the varying parameters of copolymer synthesis and their significance.

I would also like to thank Matt Hamada for his help overlooking my code and providing programming guidance.
